# Requirements
- Lite XL 2.1+
- ltreesitter master via Luarocks (`luarocks install ltreesitter --local --dev`)

# Install
## Express Install
Evergreen can be easily installed with [Miq](https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Miq) by
adding this to your plugin declaration:
```lua
	{'TorchedSammy/Evergreen.lxl', run = 'luarocks install ltreesitter --local --dev'},
```

## Manually
- Git clone Evergreen into Lite XL plugins directory
Or symlink:  
```
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Evergreen.lxl
ln -s ~/Downloads/Evergreen.lxl ~/.config/lite-xl/plugins/evergreen
```

# Usage
To use Evergreen, you have to install the parser for your language of choice.
This can be done with the `Evergreen: Install` command.  

Once there is a log that the install has completed, you can start coding
with Treesitter highlighting! It's that easy.
